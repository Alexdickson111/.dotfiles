00:00:00.060 The next story, one of Cain and Abel, and it plays on that because in a very interesting way because
00:00:06.549 It indicates what happens and I would say it it
00:00:11.080 What supports my general hypothesis about what the first story means because what happens with Cain and Abel?
00:00:18.000 Is that well, they're brothers, right? And...
00:00:21.520 so hypothetically the first two real human beings. And they don't really like each other.
00:00:27.220 Abel is a good guy by all appearances.
00:00:30.849 God smiles on him, fate smiles on him.
00:00:33.480 How about if we put it that way - everything that he does seems to work out. Well, he makes
00:00:38.770 sacrifices which the text insists upon and the sacrifices are rewarded by God. That's a very very very very
00:00:47.200 important crucial
00:00:49.000 document because we already noted that men and women
00:00:53.620 had discovered time in
00:00:56.320 Genesis, they discovered the duration of their life and the existence of death and the
00:01:00.940 necessity for toil and by the time we get to Cain and Abel human beings have discovered in this dramatic manner that if they make
00:01:09.159 sacrifices in the present that
00:01:11.560 hypothetically, the future can be better and that's that's like, I don't know if that's not the major discovery of mankind -
00:01:18.960 it's certainly among the top one or two,
00:01:21.820 because it's very it's really something for a creature for an animal like us to notice
00:01:27.880 that if we give up something that we want right now -
00:01:31.180 we can sort of bargain with fate, as it were, to get something better in the future.
00:01:36.159 And that's really what you do when you work, right?
00:01:38.790 Because when you work,
00:01:39.850 by definition, you're doing things that you'd rather not do right now because otherwise, it wouldn't be work.
00:01:45.329 And the reason that you're doing that is because you think: "well if I give up what I really want to do,
00:01:49.990 impulsively right now, then over the medium to long term, things will be better."
00:01:54.329 And so you learn, you believe that making the appropriate sacrifices
00:01:58.719 propitiates God, let's say
00:02:03.189 metaphorically, and
00:02:04.810 Abel's sacrifices work, man.
00:02:06.909 Everything he touches turns to
00:02:08.709 sheep and camels, and women, and he has everything he wants. And everyone likes him, and everybody thinks he's a good guy. And
00:02:16.000 you know, that's pretty good for Abel, but Cain isn't doing so well and
00:02:22.209 nothing he
00:02:24.160 sacrifices appears to have the proper effect and there is some idea in the story that maybe the
00:02:30.489 sacrifices he makes are a little bit on the half-hearted side. And
00:02:34.300 that God isn't all that thrilled at those sacrifices as a consequence. And that's really we're thinking about again for about 50 years
00:02:42.580 because it is
00:02:44.140 possible that if you're making
00:02:45.760 sacrifices and they're not working out that well that it's not so much that God hates you -
00:02:51.420 it's that your sacrifices could be of a somewhat higher quality, right? That you're playing a game
00:02:58.420 with yourself and with the structure of reality and you think you can get away with it. And
00:03:03.730 you can't, and the fact that you're not getting away with it and that you can't - makes you bitter and resentful,
00:03:09.670 and cruel, and vengeful, and
00:03:12.130 homicidal
00:03:13.180 eventually. And worse than that because there are far worse places than you can go,
00:03:17.680 that you can go, than merely homicidal. Anyways, Cain has enough of this one day
00:03:23.200 and he says to... he, Cain, decides to have a chat with God and it goes something like this -
00:03:29.290 it's quite an arrogant chat, really.
00:03:32.860 It's almost as arrogant as Adam's was stupid.
00:03:37.299 And Cain basically challenges God. He says look, I don't know what sort of world you think you put together here, but
00:03:45.430 we've got Abel and we've got me and like everything's just working out for him
00:03:50.280 and you know
00:03:51.190 He's perfectly goddamn delightful and everyone likes him and and whatever he touches
00:03:57.900 like King Midas turns to gold and it's all easy for him and
00:04:03.340 then there's me and I'm like breaking myself in half here and I'm offering up my
00:04:08.740 sacrifices and like you turn your nose up at them and nothing works out for me. And
00:04:13.930 implying, by the way, that it's God's fault. I would say more than implying -
00:04:19.779 stating quite
00:04:21.668 forthrightly that it's God's fault which, you know, takes a certain degree of arrogance
00:04:27.240 you might think and
00:04:28.419 that's also worth thinking about for a very long period of time because it is possible that if things are going well for
00:04:34.930 someone that you know and not going so well for you...
00:04:38.380 That it is a consequence of the quality of your sacrifices.
00:04:42.240 And I don't want to push that too far because I know that people have bad luck,
00:04:46.139 you know, because we are fragile creatures intrinsically and terrible things can happen to us on a somewhat random basis.
00:04:53.460 But it's still very much worth
00:04:55.750 considering that's the rule in Chapter six: "put your house in order before you
00:05:01.419 criticize the world". That
00:05:04.419 the reason that things aren't turning out for you as well as they might - is because your sacrifices just
00:05:11.169 don't have enough blood in them. They're just not what they should be.
00:05:16.440 You're not putting your full heart into it and as a consequence - you're not
00:05:21.310 reaping
00:05:22.690 the fee, you're not reaping the crop that you might otherwise so. And
00:05:27.520 that's a harsh thing to think but that's actually what God tells Cain which is quite interesting. I read a lot of different
00:05:34.090 translations trying to understand this and what God basically says is:
00:05:38.020 "Look,
00:05:40.180 buddy...
00:05:44.199 Before you dare to criticize the creator of
00:05:48.759 the world or reality itself for that matter, you might give some thought to your own actions and here's how I look at it,
00:05:56.830 being God and all,
00:05:59.440 You're in a house and there's a doorway and in the doorway
00:06:02.370 there's a predatory cat and it's sexually aroused and it's after you. And
00:06:09.520 you invite it in
00:06:11.860 voluntarily. And you let it have its way with you. And
00:06:18.310 something's produced as a consequence of that. That's well, you might say unholy,
00:06:24.009 and what's the idea?.. and the idea is, well...
00:06:27.490 It's sin that crouches out the door... and that means to miss the mark,
00:06:32.250 it means to make an error and it's something you have to invite into your life.
00:06:37.440 But it isn't just that you invite it in and it stands with you...
00:06:41.080 It's that you invited in - this malevolent way of being, and
00:06:47.080 you enter into a creative union with it?"
00:06:50.850 That's symbolized in this particular story, using a sexual metaphor, and it's the combination of your perverse, will and this
00:06:59.199 capacity for cruelty and malevolence that you meld together into something that's uniquely
00:07:05.440 pathological and yours!" And
00:07:07.810 that's basically what God tells Cain: "that's what you've done and that's why your life isn't turning out as
00:07:13.990 well as it might or as well as your brother's, and so why don't you
00:07:20.139 get the hell out of my sight and think about that for a while?!" And
00:07:25.720 Cain leaves and he's not happy about it at all!
00:07:30.310 Which is fully understandable because you know, if you're having a wretched time of it, then you're having a wretched time of it.
00:07:36.510 And then if your brother's doing well, you know, that's just
00:07:40.389 salt in your wounds, man. And then...
00:07:43.419 then maybe you could rationalize that because the world's unfair and your brother is lucky and you're unlucky... And all of that... and you can,
00:07:51.310 you know,
00:07:52.419 reserve a little bit of self-respect as a consequence of that rationalization,
00:07:56.620 even though it's pretty thin, but then you decide to go and have it out with God and
00:08:01.539 he just basically says "no, that's all
00:08:05.200 lies. And it's actually a hundred percent,
00:08:08.889 not only a hundred percent your fault, but something that you've done
00:08:13.330 voluntarily and that you know, you did, and that you made far worse by
00:08:18.220 doing it voluntarily and now you're lying about it and complaining about the structure of reality." And
00:08:25.690 so, of all the bad news you could possibly get about why it is that things aren't going well for you, that's
00:08:33.820 the worst!
00:08:35.679 Especially if it's actually delivered by God because then - it's hard to argue with.
00:08:44.500 So what happens? Well, you'd think that maybe if Cain had any sense (which he doesn't - he's too far gone) -
00:08:51.720 he'd go sit in a cave for about a decade, and eat
00:08:55.480 locusts and honey,
00:08:56.190 if he could find some, and think about all the terrible things he did, and
00:09:00.460 then come out and like apologize to Abel and to the people he didn't do well for, and like with a little humility -
00:09:09.310 start again... and maybe have a life, but that isn't what happens...
00:09:15.100 What happens is that he decides he's going to take revenge and he takes revenge in a terrible way.
00:09:21.040 He kills Abel and then you think well, what does that mean?
00:09:25.810 And this is a terrible story, right?
00:09:27.930 Because it's really the first story about human beings
00:09:30.430 that we have at the base of our culture. Because Adam and Eve were made by God,
00:09:34.860 so they don't count. Cain and Abel - they were born - they count. And so the first story - is this terrible murder of a brother. And
00:09:42.550 a murder that was motivated by jealousy and spite for
00:09:47.980 for
00:09:49.630 for for
00:09:51.190 living positively in the world.
00:09:53.890 Right? It's about the worst story you could imagine. And so Cain goes and kills Abel. And...
00:10:01.210 God, you know...
00:10:03.460 asks him about it.
00:10:04.500 And Cain says: "Well,
00:10:05.400 am I my brother's keeper?" And that doesn't work out so well because God has actually figured it out.
00:10:10.260 And Cain says: "my punishment is more than I can bear". And it might be because God has banished him.
00:10:16.680 He's put a mark on him and banished him and told people to leave Cain the hell alone.
00:10:20.530 And I think that was to stop like a cycle of revenge killings,
00:10:25.290 let's say, although it's complicated to say... but maybe his
00:10:29.260 punishment is more than he can bear because there's a problem when you take your ideal,
00:10:34.240 let's say, Abel (happens to be your brother).
00:10:36.780 But your ideal, the person you really wish you could be, because that's what Cain wants, and then you kill it.
00:10:43.000 You've killed your ideal. You've destroyed your ideal. And then what do you have?
00:10:47.170 You've got nothing because you need an ideal to live for and if you destroy your ideal -
00:10:52.610 then you've got nothing! And Cain says: "well,
00:10:54.450 my punishment is more than I can bear and maybe that's because life without that ideal is more than can be borne. And...
00:11:03.850 Well...
00:11:06.040 It gets worse from there really, because you know,
00:11:08.560 it isn't only that Abel... that Cain killed Abel to get rid of Abel. That's bad enough.
00:11:15.080 It's plenty bad. Even at the cost of his own soul, in some sense,
00:11:19.630 which was something Cain was apparently willing to sacrifice.
00:11:22.610 But the real reason that he did it was to shake his fists in anger at the structure of reality
00:11:29.000 itself - the unfairness of being. And then that's
00:11:32.690 metaphorically represented as the proclivity to take revenge on God by destroying
00:11:37.880 God's ideal and so the story is even darker than mere murder because it goes farther down than just
00:11:45.470 homicide. And if you're wondering why it is that people do the terrible things
00:11:49.870 they do, that are truly terrible, the things that are almost incomprehensively
00:11:54.500 terrible - you have to go beyond
00:11:56.600 mere motivation for homicide and even torture and homicide and you have to look at the motivations that will turn
00:12:03.710 human beings against being itself.
